/**
 * A basic shopping list manager.
 * Each item has date-times of creation and last edit, a description, and an optional quantity.
 * The user can enter a command to create, edit or delete a line item. There should also be a command to list all line items in order of entry creation or edit date-time descending or ascending.
 * The line items should be persisted, so that all details are available when the program is next restarted.
 * Each line item should also have an automatically-generated ID for the user to use for edit and delete.
